# Bubble, Insertion, and, Merge Sort Algorithms in Java

My university made me do these and it would be a waste not to keep these

## Additional Information

- I don't copy others' work, I wrote these algorithms purely by myself with the help of algorithm visualization GIF images in wikipedia.
- My algorithm may not be fully optimized.
- The variables in my code are intended to be as descriptive as possible. I'm sorry if it doesn't suit your taste or you have trouble in understanding it as it is meant to be clear only to me.
